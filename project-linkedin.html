            <h2>Background</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-12"><br>
            <p>I recently read an <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/ethnography-matters/why-big-data-needs-thick-data-b4b3e75e3d7">article</a> by Tricia Wang (tech ethnographer) about how we’ve all come to know and love the tech buzz word “big data” and its revolutionary impact on how businesses make design decisions. It is becoming easier and easier to store, analyze, and investigate big data, leading to a dependence on quantitative data to model and predict user decisions. However, while the big data industry is worth over $122 billion, 73% of big data projects are not even profitable — many companies are investing in big data, but aren’t making effective design decisions or seeing meaningful returns. The lack of thick data or qualitative data could be the reason why.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-12"><br>
            <p>And so, I went on an adventure to gather some qualitative data and conduct a user research study to improve a product. I wanted to choose a product that I cared about and would be applicable to the demographic I had in front of me. As this was done at Microsoft’s week-long hackathon amongst hundreds of professionals, I thought a good choice would be LinkedIn. Given that almost all of the participating users were developers employed at a large tech company, I knew the study would be susceptible to some level of bias.</p>

            <h2>What I Wanted to Accomplish</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-12"><br>
            <p>Before I began the study I did some research online to better understand some of the product’s limitations. What I ended up finding were hundreds of job-related articles on ‘How to Have a Killer LinkedIn Profile Page’ and statistics along the lines of ‘LinkedIn profiles with ____ get X times more profile views’. And so, I chose a broad theme I wanted to focus on for my study:</p>
            <br><h5><i>How can we redesign LinkedIn's profile page to differentiate individual users' profiles?</i></h5>
            <br><p>To answer this, I ended up conducting short interviews (~5 min each) with 41 people. I started the interviews with relatively simple, background questions about the person’s occupation, years at the company, and day-to-day tasks. I followed this up by asking them to describe some of their best career moments that helped accelerate them to where they are today and what they would look for in prospective candidates. Finally, I wanted to know a little bit about their behaviour/activity on LinkedIn and opinion on the product’s usefulness...</p>
            <br><p>To check out the complete analysis and redesign, make sure to read the full article, available <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@shanpruthi/linkedin-a-closer-look-1732f41ac8d5">here</a>.</p>
